# **COVID-Tracker**

I made this project under the [CLIQUE ORGANISATIONS](https://twitter.com/clique_org)

Fetch the COVID current Data from the API [https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series)

I have used 3 CSV files 
*  time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv
*  time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv
*  time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv

## Made this Project using 
* SpringBoot 
* Thymleaf
* HTML & CSS

Used **SpringBoot** as Backend  and **Html, CSS & BootStrap and Thymleaf** as a Frontend

ROADMAP 
* Learn SpringBoot from Youtube Tutorials  [Spring Boot Quick Start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msXL2oDexqw&list=PLqq-6Pq4lTTbx8p2oCgcAQGQyqN8XeA1x)
1. Fetch the Data from Github API.
1. Made a Service class provide all the services like fetching the data as country-wise and state-wise.
1. Make a Model class to fetch the data.
1. Make a controller class to Map the request coming from the user.

* Learn Thymleaf to put the data accordingly in Webpages.

1.[Refer this](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling.

2. Use Chart.js for Graphs
